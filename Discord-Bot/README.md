Setup:
    you get the API from the discord developer portal site. you select bot and copy the token. it must go into a
    .env file within the Discord-Bot directory. since it is sensitive information, a gitignore file must be created.
    the dependencies needed are discord.py and python-dotenv
Usage: 
    you can type 'speak!' into the server and the bot will respond with a quote from the office
Research:
    you can either keep a computer running 24/7 or you have a server created online to host the program
